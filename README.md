> _Aim_: download random plenary speeches by [MEPs][dir] from the 5th (1999-2004), 6th (2004-2009) and 7th (2009-2014) terms of the European Parliament.

# WHY

This project is neither [ParlTrack](http://parltrack.euwiki.org/) or [VoteWatch](http://www.votewatch.eu/):

1. __The data is as longitudinal as possible__, which currently means 15 years from legislature 5 (1999-2004) to today (legislature 7, 2009-2014). This is useful because parliamentary data are fundamentally interval census (some MEPs are present in all three sessions).
2. __The focus is neither presence or roll calls__: the data are full paragraphs of _full text sentences_, spoken or written by MEPs during plenary sessions ('speech acts'). Around 80% of all speech acts were delivered in English (the second most presented EU language, French, ranks at less than 5%).
3. __The data are aimed at running topic models__, as in [Di Maggio _et al._ 2013](http://www.theculturelab.umd.edu/uploads/1/4/2/2/14225661/exploitingaffinities_dimaggio.pdf) and [Fligstein _et al._ 2014](http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/fligstein/Why%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20Failed%20to%20See%20the%20Crisis%20of%202008%20v.2.6.pdf). The grouping variables for spoken/written items are MEPs, party families, procedure codes and Dewey-style thematic classes from the European Parliament Legislative Observatory.

# DEPENDENCIES

The scripts require the following packages:

```{S}
library(XML)       # parser for HTML web pages
library(jsonlite)  # parser for JSON results
library(plyr)      # data manipulation
library(dplyr)     # fast data manipulation
library(slam)      # simple triplet matrix representation
library(tm)        # document-term matrix representation
library(SnowballC) # stemmer
library(qdap)      # polarity
```

Some packages require R 3.0.x, but `scraper.r` can be edited to run on R 2.15.x.

# HOWTO

The main entry point is `make.r`. Adjust the `sample` setting to _n_ / 5 where _n_ is the maximum number of random speech acts that you want to download.

There were roughly 270,000 speech acts as of May 2014, so setting `sample` to `75000` should get you almost all available speech acts for legislatures 5â€“7.

The default setting gets 5,000 items by iterating 5 times over 1,000 items, to fix network errors. Please let me know if you need a more workable version.

# CODEBOOK

The `speeches` objects holds:

* `id`: the MEP unique identifier for the speaker (integer)
* `leg`: the legislature (integer)
* `title`: the title of the speech intervention (often uninformative)
* `titleUrl`: the URL to the full text
* `language`: a useless language code (always says 'en')
* `formatList`: empty
* `referenceList`: the code of the procedure to which the speech relates         
* `displayLanguageWarning`: always `FALSE`
* `date`: the date of the speech (dd-mm-yyyy)
* `type`: always `CRE` (plenary session speech/written statement)
* `committeeList`: empty
* `voteExplanationList`: unprocessed
* `lang`: the true language (read from the web page)
* `text`: the raw full text of the speech
* `sample`: whether the speaker of the speech is known (should always be `TRUE`)
* `proc`: the procedure code of the speech (used to get the next columns)
* `subj`: the Dewey-style subject codes of the procedure
* `also`: related preocdure codes
* `oeil`: theme (if the procedure is part of the Observatory's selection)
* `corpus`: whether the item is part of the document-term matrix
* `polarity`: the [polarity](https://trinker.github.io/qdap/polarity.html) score of the item, using the [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) dictionary

Please open an issue if you need the proper codebook I did not bother to write.
